Context-Aware CAN Bus Anomaly Detection with LSTM & LSTM-VAE

📌 Overview

This repository showcases the research and implementation of context-aware anomaly detection in automotive Controller Area Network (CAN) systems without requiring signal decoding (DBC files).
The project introduces LSTM Autoencoder and LSTM Variational Autoencoder (VAE) models for identifying context-aware anomalies such as replay attacks, fuzzing, and timing deviations.

🚀 Key Features

No-Decoding Paradigm – Analyze CAN traffic as raw time-series data without proprietary decoding.

Sequence-Aware Models – LSTM and LSTM-VAE provide deep contextual understanding of CAN bus data.

Replay & Fuzz Detection – Accurately detects replayed or fuzzed CAN messages with minimal tuning.

Visualization – Generates anomaly scores, entropy heatmaps, and ID frequency spikes.

Colab-Optimized – Run the entire pipeline with GPU acceleration for rapid experimentation.

📊 Usage
1️⃣ Prepare Logs

Collect CAN logs for training and testing:

candump vcan0 -l > normal.log
candump vcan0 -l > attack.log

2️⃣ Run on Google Colab

Open LSTM_VAE.ipynb or LSTM_Final.ipynb in Google Colab
.

Upload your normal.log and attack.log files when prompted.

Execute each cell to preprocess data, train the model, and analyze anomalies.

3️⃣ Replay Attack Simulation

Use Replay.ipynb to simulate replay attacks and validate detection performance.

📈 Outputs

Top Anomalous CAN IDs – Ranked by anomaly scores

Entropy Heatmaps – Payload randomness visualization

Timing Deviations – Highlights sequence and delta timing anomalies

Score Plots – Time-series graphs for anomaly scores over time
